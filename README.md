Selenium Cucumber Framework with Java
Overview
This repository contains a Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber framework for automating web-based tests using the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach with Java. It is designed for easy scalability and maintainability of automated tests.

The framework includes support for feature files, step definitions, page objects, and reports generation using ExtentReports and log4j for logging. The tests are written using Cucumber in a feature file format with Gherkin syntax, making them easily understandable by non-developers.

Project Structure
src/main/java: Contains Java code for step definitions, page object models, and utility classes.
src/test/resources: Contains feature files for Cucumber tests written in Gherkin syntax.
src/test/java: Contains Cucumber test runners and Java classes for running the tests.
logs/: Stores logs generated by log4j during the test execution.
test-output/: Contains Extent Reports generated after test execution.
Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

Java JDK 11 or above
Maven (for dependency management)
Selenium WebDriver
Cucumber dependencies
ChromeDriver (or other WebDriver based on the browser you're using)
You also need to configure your local environment for these dependencies and tools.

Setting up the Project
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/lavanyap2823/ToDoMVC.git
cd selenium-cucumber-framework
2. Install Dependencies
The project uses Maven to manage dependencies. To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy
mvn clean install
This will download and set up all necessary dependencies defined in the pom.xml file.

Project Configuration
1. WebDriver Setup
You will need a browser driver (such as ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox, etc.) to run the Selenium tests.

Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
Set the path to the WebDriver in the driver setup within the test configuration or as a system property.
Example for ChromeDriver:

java
Copy
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver");
Alternatively, set the WebDriver path in your system environment variables.

Running Tests
1. Run the Cucumber Tests with Maven
To run the tests using Maven, execute the following command from the root directory:

bash
Copy
mvn test
This will trigger the Cucumber tests, execute the test scenarios, and generate reports.

2. Running Tests in IDE
You can also run the tests directly from your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse):

Open the TestRunner class (which is responsible for executing the tests).
Run it as a JUnit test.
Generating Reports
1. Cucumber Reports
After running the tests, Cucumber reports will generate a comprehensive HTML report that includes detailed execution results such as:

Test Name
Status (Pass/Fail)
Execution time
Error stack traces
Screenshots (if configured)
The reports are saved in the target folder under the name cucumber-report.html.

2. Log4j Logging
Logs generated by the framework during test execution are stored in logs/test-log.log. Log4j captures the following logs:

Test start and end
Step-level logs for Cucumber steps
Errors and exceptions during test execution
The log file helps in debugging test failures and tracking the flow of execution.

Implementation Strategy
1. BDD Approach with Cucumber
The tests are designed using the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) approach where:

Feature files written in Gherkin syntax describe the behavior of the application from the user's perspective.
Step Definitions map the Gherkin steps to Java code.
Test Runner is used to integrate Cucumber and JUnit, allowing execution of tests in an organized manner.
2. Page Object Model (POM)
We follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to separate the test logic from the page interaction logic:

Page classes represent individual web pages and provide methods to interact with elements on the page.
Test classes use these page classes to execute user flows and validate the application behavior.
3. Logging with Log4j
Log4j is used to capture detailed logs during the test execution. The logs provide insights into the actions taken during the test and can be used for troubleshooting test failures.
The logs are written to the logs/test-log.log file.
4. Reporting with ExtentReports
ExtentReports provides a rich, visual report in HTML format, giving an easy-to-read summary of the test execution.
The report is stored in the test-output/extent-report.html file.
Customization & Extensibility
You can easily extend this framework by adding more feature files and step definitions for new application features.
If you'd like to add support for other browsers, just update the WebDriver setup in the Test Setup class.
You can configure Log4j settings to capture more or fewer details based on your needs.

Conclusion
This framework provides an easy-to-use structure for automating web-based tests using Selenium, Cucumber, and Java. The combination of BDD, Page Object Model, Log4j, and Extent Reports ensures clear test execution, effective debugging, and comprehensive reporting.
